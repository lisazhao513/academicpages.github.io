**Text Analysis of the Simpsons Transcript**  
Click [here](https://lisazhao.shinyapps.io/simpson_text_analysis/) to view the R shiny app. Feel free to play around a bit!  

In my STAT 133 (Concepts of Computing with Data) class, I developed my first R Shiny app, focusing on text analysis of The Simpsons transcripts spanning 33 seasons. The project involved challenges due to the large dataset and new enviornment. Despite these hurdles, I successfully implemented word frequency and n-gram analyses. The significance of using a Shiny app for visualization adds an interactive dimension.
